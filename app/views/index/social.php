		<p>The Students’ Union carries out its activities based on the status and the action programs adopted by its Directory Board.
			The Students’ Union has the following goals:
			defence and representation of the interests of all the students in the University, promoting the competent students in the
			leadership structures of the faculties and of the university, in boarding commissions, Students’ Hostels and in other administrative
			structures that can be made up of students as well;
			carrying out activities with a professional, social, cultural, sportive and economic character;
			editing publications;
			defending students’ rights in case they are infringed and if the students had to suffer physically, morally or educationally,
			supporting the democratic demand of other apolitical organizations and speaking out against the disregard for Human Rights.
			Out of the projects realized, there are: the promotion of Valahia University Targoviste, the job market for students and the
			constant participation to the national students’ events.
